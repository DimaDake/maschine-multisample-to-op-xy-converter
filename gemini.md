# Gemini Contribution Guidelines

## Testing

After making any changes that affect the converter's functionality (e.g., modifying `converter.html` or the test itself), you must run the end-to-end test suite to ensure that nothing has broken.

To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm test
```

Ensure that all tests pass before committing your changes.
